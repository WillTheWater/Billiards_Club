Physics Engine: 

- Test that the refacting has worked

- Now that table has getBounds (Top, left, right, etc), update the BvTable collisions to use that. 

- Generate a debug randomizer so we can test if the collisions are working

- Collisions with sf::vector2f to deal with angled walls (This one will hurt)

Input: 

- Literally everything                                 

Rendering: 

- Need some way to either index textures by ball_id, or have balls hold a pointer to their texture and initialize them with it. 
- Learn how to render a texture with a SFML_circle;
